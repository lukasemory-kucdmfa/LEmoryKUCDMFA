There is a consistent use of rounded rectangles and subtle layering and drop shadows to give dimension to the design. Text is good size and color contrastt is good. There is a very clear heirarchy for font sizes so the headlines 'Profile & Settings', 'Security', and 'Help Center' are easy to quickly find. There is text that says the name of the user, in this case 'Lukas' which makes the brand feel more approachable.
